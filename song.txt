look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
or a perfect daughter
can it be
i'm not meant to play this part?

now I see
that I were ever to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that gitl I see
staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know

Somehow I cannot hide who I am
though I've tried

Somehow I cannot hide who I am
though I've tried 
When will my reflection show 
who I am inside

When will my reflection show 
who I am inside
